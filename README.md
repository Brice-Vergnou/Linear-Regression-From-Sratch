# Linear Regression from scratch

Create a linear regression from scratch , just using numpy arrays

It allowed me to understand the concepts , the math behind this algorithm , and some principles about metrics . It was also a great experience to work with numpy arrays.


## Usage

Clone the repository

` git clone https://github.com/Brice-Vergnou/Linear-Regression-From-Sratch.git `

Install the dependencies

` pip install -r requirements.txt `

Run the code !

` python3 linear_reg.py `

You can tweak the code if you want to :

* Line 48 , n_samples : The number of samples
* Line 48 , n_features : The number of features
* Line 50 , lr : The learning rate
* Line 50 , n_iter : The number of iterations
